# üßÆ Commercial

If you wish to use this project for commercial gain, I hope you will respect open source and strictly adhere to the AGPL-3.0 license, giving back to the open source community. Or contact the author for an independent commercial license.

# üßÆ Commercial Use

- This project prohibits closed-source commercial use. If you wish to use PPTist for commercial projects and profit, please respect open source and **strictly follow the [AGPL-3.0 Agreement](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)**, giving back to the open source communityÔºõ
- If you, for any reason, must close the source for commercial use and cannot execute the AGPL-3.0 agreement, you can choose:
  1. Use the early Apache 2.0 agreement version [ÔºàThe last update of this version was in May 2022, and it has been stopped maintaining. Click here to download the codeÔºâ](https://github.com/pipipi-pikachu/PPTist/archive/f1a35bb8e045124e37dcafd6acbf40b4531b69aa.zip)Ôºõ
  2. Become an important contributor to the project (violating the agreement first and then becoming a contributor is not included in this scope), including:
     - Your code is referenced as a dependency by this project, including: npm installation, script/style and other file references, code snippet references (the reference will be noted)Ôºõ
     - You have submitted important PRs to this project that have been merged (subject to the author's subjective judgment)Ôºõ
     - You have long participated in the maintenance/promotion of this project, such as providing effective peripheral tools for this project, making a large number of templates, etc. (subject to the author's subjective judgment)Ôºõ
  3. [Email the author](mailto:pipipi_pikachu@163.com) to pay for an independent commercial license. Independent authorization prices:
     - 1999 yuan for one year
     - 2999 yuan for three years
     - 5499 yuan permanently
- It is recommended to prioritize the implementation of the AGPL-3.0 agreement. If you want to pay for an independent commercial license, please note:
  - Independent commercial authorization means: authorizing you to use the code for commercial purposes separately without having to perform the AGPL-3.0 agreementÔºõ
  - Only authorization (not sale of software or services), there is no other "advanced version/paid version", no online services are provided, no technical support or technical consulting is provided, no custom development is provided, no more templates are provided, let alone deliverable productsÔºõ
  - The software cannot be used out of the box. At the very least, it is necessary to access the back-end data reading/storage capabilities. Therefore, using this project requires the most basic web development experience (understanding what front-end & back-end are, where data comes from & how to store it, what interfaces are, what cross-domain issues are, etc.)Ôºõ
  - After authorization, it is still prohibited to resell, authorize, open source, or maliciously spread the source codeÔºõ
  - After authorization, AIPPT-related background logic and current template data can be provided for reference if needed (but they are very simple, without any core logic, and it is more recommended to implement them by yourself)Ôºõ
  - Be sure to do your research in advance to determine whether PPTist meets your needs, both in terms of functionality (whether it meets business requirements) and development (whether you accept the current tech stack/implementation plan)Ôºõ
  - The author is an asynchronous communication practitioner, **does not add WeChat/QQ/mobile phone number, etc.**, any authorization-related questions please contact by email, and for ÈúÄÊ±Ç/Êä• bug/ËØ¢ÈóÆÊäÄÊúØÊñπÊ°àÁ≠âËØ∑Âú® [Issues](https://github.com/pipipi-pikachu/PPTist/issues) ‰∏≠ËøõË°åÔºåË∞¢Ë∞¢ÁêÜËß£„ÄÇ

# üîî Other Instructions

## What is the AGPL-3.0 Agreement

The core requirements of the agreement are explained in simple language as follows:

- **Open Source Obligation**: If you use AGPL code, regardless of how you or your downstream users use/modify it, you must publicly disclose all of your final code (not just the modified parts, and not just rewriting it in a different framework to disconnect it from the original code), and continue to open source it under the AGPL agreement, maintaining the infectious nature of open source.
- **Network services must also be open source**: Even if you only use AGPL code to create a website or web service, when others use your service over the network, you must also comply with the above-mentioned **Open Source Obligation**.
- **Retain copyright notice**: You cannot remove the original author information and license notice from the code, you must inform others where the code came from.
- **No additional restrictions**: You cannot add restrictions on AGPL code, such as prohibiting others from redistributing it, or requiring others to pay to use the code.
- **Disclaimer**: The author does not guarantee that the code is bug-free, nor is he responsible for the consequences of its use.
