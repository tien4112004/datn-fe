# Quickstart: Class Management API

This document outlines how to quickly interact with the Class Management API endpoints using `curl`.

## 1. Create a New Class

To create a new class, send a `POST` request to `/api/classes` with the class details in the request body.

### Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/classes \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Mathematics 101",
    "description": "Introduction to advanced mathematics.",
    "teacherId": "teacher-123",
    "studentIds": ["student-a", "student-b"],
    "schedule": "2025-12-01T09:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### Expected Response (201 Created):

```json
{
  "id": "autogenerated-class-id",
  "name": "Mathematics 101",
  "description": "Introduction to advanced mathematics.",
  "teacherId": "teacher-123",
  "studentIds": ["student-a", "student-b"],
  "schedule": "2025-12-01T09:00:00Z"
}
```

## 2. Update an Existing Class

To update an existing class, send a `PUT` request to `/api/classes/{classId}` with the updated class details in the request body.

Replace `autogenerated-class-id` with the actual ID of the class you want to update.

### Request:

```bash
# Assuming 'autogenerated-class-id' is the ID of the class to update
curl -X PUT \
  http://localhost:3000/api/classes/autogenerated-class-id \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "autogenerated-class-id",
    "name": "Mathematics 101 - Advanced",
    "description": "Advanced topics in mathematics.",
    "teacherId": "teacher-123",
    "studentIds": ["student-a", "student-b", "student-c"],
    "schedule": "2025-12-05T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### Expected Response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "id": "autogenerated-class-id",
  "name": "Mathematics 101 - Advanced",
  "description": "Advanced topics in mathematics.",
  "teacherId": "teacher-123",
  "studentIds": ["student-a", "student-b", "student-c"],
  "schedule": "2025-12-05T10:00:00Z"
}
```
