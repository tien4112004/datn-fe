# Quickstart: Subject Context View

This document provides a quick overview of the new "Subject Context View" feature.

## 1. View Switching

A new view mode toggle has been added to the "Schedule" tab. This allows you to switch between the "Day View" and the "Subject View".

## 2. Subject Selector

In "Subject View", a dropdown menu allows you to select a subject.

## 3. Subject Period List

Once a subject is selected, a chronological list of all periods for that subject is displayed. Each item in the list shows the date, time, and the mapped lesson (if any).
